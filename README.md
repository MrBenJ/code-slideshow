## The easy to use Coding Slideshow plugin

In written programming tutorials, it's difficult to show a progression of steps just because of the nature of the web and how humans tend to scroll vertically for the next steps.

With **CodeSlide** you can easily create simple short slideshows with annotations to quickly show a progression of code.
